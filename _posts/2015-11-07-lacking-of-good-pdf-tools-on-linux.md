I use two machines (_mainly_), one of them is a old school, die hard, Mac Mini Mid 2010 
running OSX 10.10 called Amanda. The another one is a low end Samsung notebook called Helena.   
On Helena i run [Ubuntu-Mate 15.04](https://ubuntu-mate.org/) (I will post about 
this awesome distro later) and sadly I cannot find a good PDF annotation tool for her. 

Linux lacks some good stuff that is take for granted on OSX this is understandable,
as well Linux has a lot of good stuff that isn't found in any other system, but what
puzzles me is while almost all other tools are neck to neck with the proprietary ones, 
if not better, the PDF tools are awful.

Don't get me wrong, I __really love__ free software, but I'm very realistic too.   

In my opinion Envince is poor, Okular is __very, very, very__ heavy-weight 
(as the whole KDE stuff).    
While Okular has some (lacking of user friendliness) options to annotate PDF, it
is very heavy to my machine. I really don't want to wait 5-10 seconds to load a 300+
pages PDF.    
In Amanda (notice that her is a __5 years old__ machine, running almost up to 
date software) this happens almost instantaneously.

The closest thing that i found was [xournal](http://xournal.sourceforge.net), this piece 
of software is very cool.   
While it isn't a tool for PDF but instead is an annotation/notes/drawing/etc tool, 
it let's us annotate in PDF too. You can think xournal as the Microsoft OneNote - 
Impressively a software from Microsoft that doesn't sucks.

But not all the things are good, the major drawback that I found is that xournal 
__DOES NOT__ save your annotations  into the PDF, instead it uses it's own format.
(This is understandable, the xournal wasn't made to do what I want).   
Of course we have the option to export the whole thing into the PDF, but even so 
the annotations aren't search-able, indexable an so on, all thing are merged into the PDF.

This is the very first thing that I want in this type of tool - i.e. 
I want make my annotations and keep this glued together with the rest of the PDF,
but more important my annotations must be indexable by other tools.
So I can search for annotation, remove them, add more, etc.

On OSX (sadly on iOS iBooks is terrible) we have two great (in my opinion, two of
finest OSX apps) readers, namely the Preview.app and the iBooks.  
Furthermore they do exactly what I expected from a PDF tool and as a big bonus they 
are very fast and lightweight.  

Is really a shame that on Linux we don't have the tools with the quality of the 
same tools on OSX.

Linux is __very, very__ nice to be a free and open system, where anyone can hack 
and make a better tool or help with current ones and the whole community gets benefited,
Sadly this tools programming are far away from my area of expertise and don't get
me interested in learn as well.

I really hope that we can get better tools in a near future.
