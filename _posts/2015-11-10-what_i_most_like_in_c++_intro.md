### Intro:

C++ is a great language, better yet, I think that C++ is the __best__ language.   
While it can be very ugly sometimes (__IMHO__ mostly because the C heritage) 
it is always very powerful.

The new (not new anymore, but new yet...) standard makes the core language and
the the standard library very pleasant to work with.

By now __all__ the major compilers implements the C++11 in a very extensive 
way.    
The [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx0x.html) 
and 
[clang](http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html) 
are very good in their support for C++11 - Sorry I really don't know about the 
MSVC, since I don't develop anything for Windows for ages.

This is not a post to fully cover the additions of the C++11 standard 
(Actually I even  know all of them). But instead I'll point the major topics 
(The ones that I get most used to), that I really like.   
While C++11 has many cool additions, I find the points bellow is the most visible to make 
the C++ _became_ really a modern and cool language.

I'll cover the following topics, but since they're big and I want write in a more
deeper way, I'll split them into a several posts.

* Lambdas.
* for range loop.
* std::function.
* auto specifier.
* Raw strings.
* Library overloads (Taking std::string).
* std::begin() and std::end().
* Smart pointers.
* Move semantics.
* Constructors.
* constexpr.

As you can see, this is just a little part of the C++11 features, but I think 
that them are the ones that the programmer will find himself using most of time.

See you in the next post - I'll be covering ```lambdas```.
