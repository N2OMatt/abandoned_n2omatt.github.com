### Intro

For the same reason that I'm writing a Study Diary, I started this Dev Diary too.   
This will enable me to be more focused in stuff that I'm doing and will do. 
Another **very** good thing is that this will let me, in the future, look back 
and check out all (_at least what I had written_) the things that I did. :)

## Ginga.One

I'm very new at [Ginga.One](http://www.gingaone.com) and while I'm very focused 
and working hard to get things along, I'm mainly getting used with the project yet.
For this reason not too big happened yet :/

What I did was:

* Correct some low profile bugs that was left behind from the last sprint.
* Sprint planning - (Scrum rocks).

## Amazing Cow

[Gosh](http://www.github.com/amazingcow/gosh) - My most loved project at AmazingCow:

* Fix some method names.   
I'm maturing in python, so now I understand the difference of stuff started with 
```_```(1 underscore) and with ```__```(2 underscores). If you don't know yet,
or want some refresh check this nice 
[article](http://igorsobreira.com/2010/09/16/difference-between-one-underline-and-two-underlines-in-python.html).
* Removed some unneeded, unused code.
* Started a new version - This is not strictly needed, but I'm very sloppy with 
my version counting and with the ```git tag`` stuff, so I decide start a new 
version and keep the things straight from now.

## Imidiar

I need add the print capability in the Photo Totem. I started study how to do 
this, but add a bare bone, class that will handle the print(er) stuff.
