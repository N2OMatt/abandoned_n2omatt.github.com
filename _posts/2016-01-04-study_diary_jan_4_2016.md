### Intro

As I'm planning to be **very** hardcore with my studies in this year, I'll every 
single day make a blog post about my study - Like this one.

This series will be called Study Diary :)

I'll try to just show what I'm study and why, but I'll try hard to enter more deeply into 
the subject that I'd study. But since my time now (I'm happy with this) is **very** scarce 
most often I think that I'll just enumerate things.

### Why?

This a funny question because I very conscious about that _almost_(**no one**) will read 
this stuff, but even so I want to have a place that I can write about what I'm doing and
more important (I think), this will enable me to after a while look back and see _exactly_
what I did.

So let's begin.

## Courses

I take some - very basic, but still fun - courses, mainly I did them when I was travelling 
from my job at [Ginga.One](http://www.gingaone.com) to home :)

#### Udemy: 

* [Learn Socket Programming in C from Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/learn-socket-programming-in-c-from-scratch).  
This was a fun course, the instructor is very nice.   
For me, that never did nothing with sockets, was very nice to have a introduction 
in this topic. 

* [Game Developers 5 Tips for Success from a Lawyer](https://www.udemy.com/game-developers-5-tips-for-success-from-a-lawyer).   
Nice explanation, nice instructor, nice tips.  **SHAME** about the presentation. 
You know, everything was really great but I think that give a course with the 
"MS Word" instead of some appealing slides was very bad. I did it mostly while 
getting some rest, because there's no need to read the stuff in the presentation.  
(If you're doing stuff with another people - games, apps, etc. and don't have 
a corporation behind you, this course is definitively worth to watch.)

#### Couchbase: 

* [Fundamentals of NoSQL Data Management](http://training.couchbase.com/online?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonuanId%2B%2FhmjTEU5z17u8rUK6%2FhIkz2EFye%2BLIHETpodcMRcBmNa%2BTFAwTG5toziV8R7PFLs1n0MwQWxLm#).   
A project that I'm involved at 
[Ginga.One](http://www.gingaone.com) 
are using the Couchbase stuff as the data storage, so since I'm very new there 
the P.O. of the project kindly sent me this stuff to me check out.   
This courses are neat, simple, well explained, definitely worth the time spend 
on. - I really loved it.    
This course in particular is very simple, explaining the fundamentals of NoSQl, 
the differences against the, more traditional, RDMS system and all this stuff. 

* [Essentials of Couchbase NoSQL Technology](http://training.couchbase.com/online?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonuanId%2B%2FhmjTEU5z17u8rUK6%2FhIkz2EFye%2BLIHETpodcMRcBmNa%2BTFAwTG5toziV8R7PFLs1n0MwQWxLm#).   
I started this, but I hadn't enough time to finished it yet. :/

## Other stuff

#### Imidiar:

I'm hacking some stuff for a long time for the guys at
[Imidiar](http://www.imidiar.com.br). This time I'm must add some printing 
capabilities at the Photo Totem software. 
So basically I'm reading about how to achieve this. 

I had to little time to study, but I think that 
[PyCups](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycups) will be the way to go.
