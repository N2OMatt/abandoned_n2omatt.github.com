## Courses

#### Udemy: 

* [Learn Objective-C Programming for iOS Apps](https://www.udemy.com/learn-objective-c-programming-for-ios-apps/learn/).  
I started the course, but didn't have time to complete it yet. :/

## Other stuff

#### Ginga.One:

I struggled a little bit understating the architeture of the 
[AVFoundation](https://developer.apple.com/av-foundation/). 
All the other stuff that I made using the camera in iOS was using the
[UIImagePickerController](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIImagePickerController_Class/)
framework.

Since I'm newbie in this subject yet, I think that is almost useless try to 
write about it at this moment - But I'm loving this neat framework and I **will**
write a lot about it in future.

#### Amazing Cow:

As I described in my 
[[Dev Diary]](https://n2omatt.github.io/dev-diary/2016/01/05/dev_diary_jan_5_2016.html)
for this day, I corrected a bug in Gosh's makefile.

The gotcha was using the ```stat(1)``` to get the original file's ownership 
before messing with it as _root_.    
Like I said in the [Dev Diary] the complete post about it can be found
[here](https://n2omatt.github.io/study-diary/2016/01/05/how_get_a_ownership_of_file_in_linux.html).
