## Ginga.One

How I said in the [Study Diary](COWTODO), the project that I'm working on must present
a _placeholder_ UI if user didn't give the right access permissions.    
More than this, we have to let user go straight to the Settings app and 
change the permissions.

But there is a caveat, we **must** support iOS 7 - That is the **only** version
that haven't a public, official way to acomplish this.

So I created in our ```Environments.h``` - A kind of ```Globals + Constants``` but
all with read-only access - some methods to check the current version of the iOS.   
This way I can see very easily which version the app is running and react accordily.

I correct some bugs. Mainly about some methods that does not exists in the iOS 7
being called.

Lastly, I start the implementation of our helper to get the user's assets...   
This was done encapsulating the - not so pretty - ALAssetsLibrary API into a 
class that exposes a more - for us - convinient interface.
