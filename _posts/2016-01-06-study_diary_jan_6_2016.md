## Ginga.One:

I faced a issue in the project that I'm in regarding the permissions of the 
camera and the assets library.   
Very briefly, we show the default prompt for user, asking he's permission about
the use of the camera and the assets library - Actually this is a default action
of the iOS.   
But if user deny the access, we must react and present a _placeholder_ UI. This 
_placeholder_ UI shows instruction about how enable the camera and the assets
library.

So far, so good...

Like almost everything, this scenario isn't perfect. We must support the iOS 7 - 
**seriously**. The desired behavior is present a automatic way - let's say a button -
that enables user go straight to the Settings app and alter the app's permissions.

I found that in iOS up to 5 there a easy way to achieve this.   
I also found that in iOS since version 8 there is a easy - but different - way to achieve this.   
I found that in **iOS 7** there is **NO WAY** to achieve this.

So we have to support two possible flows:

1. iOS 7: Just present the information.
2. iOS >7: Present the information and let the user go to settings.

Pretty easy, but boring stuff to code...

I'll write about how to go to Settings app very soon (I think...)
