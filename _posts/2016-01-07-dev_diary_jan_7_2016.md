## Ginga.One

Today mostly of things that I did I plan to write more deeply about. So I'll just
enumerate what I did:

* Make all Back Buttons in the application Chevron only.
* Continue (and almost finish) the implementation of AssetsLibraryHelper.
* Continue the implementation of our Camera View - Using ALAssetsLibrary and AVFoundation.
* Add a category to ease the creation the UIImage with rounded corners.
