### Intro:
After 7 years I (re) started playing bass again - I'm **very** happy :).


<!-- ####################################################################### -->

### Demeskalines:

Currently I'm a bass player for [Demeskalines](https://www.facebook.com/Demeskalines) 
- A Ska / Reggae / Hard Core band from Jundia√≠, SP.   
We're very focused in authoring, so we don't perform covers a lot.

Since I was invited to join the band just few weeks ago, I still haven't any 
material to show with me performing :/ - I hope that any time soon this gonna change.

### Setup: 

As I said, I didn't play for 7 years so all my gear was gone...   

Before I had:

* A Red Fender Jazz Bass - Sorry I don't remember the year or the specific model.
* A Frankbass - The neck was from an Samick J-Bass, the body was from (???) P-Bass
and the caps were DiMarzio (but again I don't remember any details).

Now I have:

* Nina - A Music Man's Stingray clone by Stringberg. This was a gift from my 
brother.   
Nina is a very low end bass, but she did impressed me with her grip. I **really**
like the neck shape (It's like, very like the Fender P-Bass neck).   
While the cap is active, I don't like the tone that the bass is giving now, So 
is already planed to get a better cap for her soon.

Here is a shot of me playing her...
