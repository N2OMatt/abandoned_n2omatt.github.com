### Imidiar

* **CTO / Partner,  June 2015 - Jan 2016**   
My job is basically bring from realm of ideas to the real world the two main
Imidiar's products. <br><br>
I rewrote the Imidiar's Photo Totem completely from scratch and I was 
the co-creator of Imidiar's Hashtag Searcher.<br><br>
In the process of rewriting the Photo Totem, I brought a whole new 
perspective to the table and at end we end using a lot of my ideas, 
ranging from very techincal - like using Linux, OpenCV - 
to very business oriented - like the new possible improvements, other business 
possibilities for it. <br><br>
The Hashtag Searcher I was involved since the very beginning and I 
helped my partner developing the whole idea - from the "Wow, this could be nice" 
to the business plan - as well programmed it alone.
